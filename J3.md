## Question 1
- Polymorphism in java is the ability for an object variable to be assigned as it's value any object that is part of a class that is a child of the variable's class 
- One place this is useful is creating methods that can take in many different objects as parameters
- You could imagine a printing method that can print an array of different objects that are passed where maybe not all of those objects are the same.

## Question 2
- Without polymorphism when you tried to assign any non base object to object the program would crash.
- Polymorphism allows this object to hold any of those variables 

## Question 3
- This returns "A"

## Question 4
- This returns "\~\~B\~\~ A"

## Question 5
- "A A"

## Question 6
- The program will compile successfully 

## Question 7

## Question 8
- "foo1: b a"

## Question 9
- "Name: fluffy\nSpecies: Canis Familaris(pomeranian)"
- "Name: george\nSpecies: Canis Familaris"
- "Name: brutus\nSpecies: Felis Catus"

## Question 11
- You can not call abstract classes directly you can only call with super. (you can also make abstract methods

## Question 12
